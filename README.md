# Advanced Zero-Trust Architecture Implementation

# Description
An advanced implementation of Zero-Trust Architecture principles using Python and Flask. This project provides a comprehensive backend system demonstrating key Zero-Trust concepts including continuous authentication, device health monitoring, and granular access control.

This implementation is designed to showcase advanced cybersecurity practices and serve as a foundation for building secure, modern applications. It incorporates industry-standard security measures and provides a platform for further enhancements and customizations.

Important! This is a proof-of-concept implementation. Additional security measures and thorough testing are required before considering production use.

## Key Features
- Advanced user authentication with password strength validation
- Device registration and health monitoring
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Continuous verification of user and device identity
- Detailed access logging and monitoring
- Integration with external services for IP reputation checking
- Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- Modular architecture for easy expansion and maintenance

# Usage

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Redis (for rate limiting)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vm32/advanced-zero-trust-architecture.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   export SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
   export JWT_SECRET_KEY='your-jwt-secret'
   export DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///zero_trust_advanced.db'
   export REDIS_URL='redis://localhost:6379'
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```
   flask db upgrade
   ```

## Running
Start the application:
```
python advanced-zero-trust-architecture.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`. Use API testing tools like Postman or curl to interact with the endpoints.

## API Endpoints
- POST /auth/register - Register a new user
- POST /auth/login - Authenticate a user and receive a JWT
- POST /device/register - Register a new device (requires authentication)
- POST /device/health_check - Perform a device health check (requires authentication)
- GET /admin/user_activity - View recent user activity (requires admin role)

## Development and Testing
Run tests:
```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Removing
To stop the application, use CTRL+C in the terminal where it's running.
